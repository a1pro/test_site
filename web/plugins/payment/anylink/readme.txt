  This plugin allows you to set any link for payment. It is useful if 
your payment processor is not supported by aMember yet. You can enter an URL
to redirect into product settings and if user chooses this payment method,
he will be redirected to this URL to make payment.
  Of course, payment will not be handled automatically, because aMember 
has no chance to know if user paid or not. However, you will receive email 
about this payment from payment processor, and you will be able to handle
this payment manually (mark it as "Paid") in aMember Control Panel. 

It is not better solution, but at least it allows you to start.


      PLUGIN INSTALLATION

1. Enable plugin at aMember CP -> Setup -> Plugins
2. Configure plugin at aMember CP -> Setup -> AnyLink
