Author: Ken Gary at Kencinnus.com
Current Version: 3.2.3.1
Upgrade Link: http://kencinnus.com/downloads/amthankyou/
Requires at least: aMember Pro v3.2.3
Tested up to: aMember Pro v3.2.3

== Description ==

The amThankYou Plugin allows your customers to see all of the links for all
of their products that they just purchased from you in the current session.
It also displays the receipts for every purchase in the current session too
so that they can print them out.  

This plugin is important if you are using the amOffers, amThankYou or 
amStrategy plugins so customers do not miss their receipts.

== Instructions ==

 1. Upload the amThankYou plugin files to the <strong>amember/plugins/protect/amthankyou/</strong> 
    folder on your server.

 2. Enable the amThankYou plugin at 
 
    <strong>aMember CP -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Setup/Configuration -&gt; Plugins</strong>

 3. Configure the amThankYou plugin at 
 
    <strong>aMember CP -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Setup/Configuration -&gt; amThankYou</strong>

    a. <strong>Debug?</strong> - 

       There may be times that you need to debug something.  This will write
       debug statements to the error log.
       
    b. <strong>Text For Please Enjoy Phrase Above Product Links</strong> -

       You can change the text that will be displayed at the top of the thank
       you page here.  It will default to <strong>Please enjoy the products you 
       have purchased today by clicking on a link below...</strong>

 4. Configure Products with Thank You Page Copy
 
    a. Visit <strong>aMember CP -&gt; Manage Products -&gt; Edit</strong>.

    b. Enter the copy you want your customers to see on the thank you page when
       they buy this product into the <strong>Thank You Page Copy</strong> field.  

       You can use HTML.

    c. Save your product.
    
    d. Repeat steps a-c for every product you want to have thank you page copy.
    
       EXAMPLE: You have a ClickBank product and they want you to display their
                specific wording on the thank you page.  You can put that here.
    
 5. As of version 3.2.3 of this plugin there is no longer a need to update 
    any aMember templates.  This plugin will work if you have the default
    templates as installed by aMember.  So you may need to UNDO any changes
    you made for previous versions of this plugin.
