<p>Several plugins have been enabled that utilize recurring credit card 
billing. As such, it is necessary to understand the related risks and liability.</p>

<p>Enabling <b>recurring</b> billing with these credit card plugins will result in active customers' credit 
card info (excluding CVV2 code, which is never saved) being stored in your MySQL database.
(if you do not enable recurring billing in product settings, no credit card
info will be stored).
</p>

<p>Utilizing shared webhosting results in an increased and serious risk that this information will be 
stolen. If you decide to use these plugins with recurring billing, you are strongly urged to acquire 
a dedicated webserver and hire a professional Unix administrator who will be able to set up a 
secure enviroment for credit card billing.</p>

<p>Utilizing shared webhosting also results in the serious risk that aMember PHP code 
will be edited. This will enable an unauthorized user to re-send credit card numbers (i.e., steal the information). As such, 
we strongly recommend that you not use shared hostings in conjunction with these plugins.</p>

<p>Processing credit card transactions on your website 
requires an SSL certificate (to get "https://" URL) that is configured 
to a Member Pro (aMember CP -> Setup -> Secure Root URL). It is your responsibility 
to ensure that all clients are submitting their credit card information via a secured connection.</p>

<p>Most importantly, your credit card processing setup must 
comply with PCI DSS policy (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_DSS" target="_blank">this link</a> for
 more information about PCI DSS). In addition, all users should contact their individual 
merchant account providers for more information about their requirements 
regarding PCI compilance. The failure to meet and maintain PCI compilance on your website will result in serious and substantial fines from credit card services (e.g., Visa and MasterCard) if 
customers' saved credit card information is stolen. As individual merchant account providers vary in their requirements, the user is responsible for contacting the providers for more details. In the case 
that PCI compliance in not attainable, to the user should 
switch to a payment processor that handles recurring credit card transactions 
internally (e.g., PayPal or 2Checkout.com).

The notices herein are not unique to Member Pro; they affect any and all custom 
or mass-selling server-side script that conducts credit card billing.
